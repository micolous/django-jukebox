# django-jukebox #

Web-based jukebox system written in Django.

This was a fork containing some patches versus the original project at [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/django-jukebox/).

# This fork is now _abandoned_. #

There are huge amount of fundamental security and "gaming" issues with the project, and to fix them would basically require an entire rewrite of the project.

**Be warned -- this is abandoned, and contains many fundamental design and security issues.  tl;dr: Do not use this as-is.**

I strongly believe in making what work I did do on an open source project available, so I have made this repository available.  However I will be not working on this further.
